	abstract = {It is accepted that many evolutionary changes of amino acid sequence in proteins are conservative: the replacement of one amino acid by another residue has a far greater chance of being accepted if the two residues have similar properties. It is difficult, however, to identify relevant physicochemical properties that capture this similarity. In this paper we introduce a criterion that determines similarity from an evolutionary point of view. Our criterion is based on the description of protein evolution by a Markov process and the corresponding matrix of instantaneous replacement rates. It is inspired by the conductance, a quantity that reflects the strength of mixing in a Markov process. Furthermore we introduce a method to divide the 20 amino acid residues into subsets that achieve good scores with our criterion. The criterion has the time-invariance property that different time distances of the same amino acid replacement rate matrix lead to the same grouping; but different rate matrices lead to different groupings. Therefore it can be used as an automated method to compare matrices derived from consideration of different types of proteins, or from parts of proteins sharing different structural or functional features. We present the groupings resulting from two standard matrices used in sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree estimation.},

	abstract = {A hidden Markov model of signal peptides has been developed. It contains submodels for the N-terminal part, the hydrophobic region, and the region around the cleavage site. For known signal peptides, the model can be used to assign objective boundaries between these three regions. Applied to our data, the length distributions for the three regions are significantly different from expectations. For instance, the assigned hydrophobic region is between 8 and 12 residues long in almost all eukaryotic signal peptides. This analysis also makes obvious the difference between eukaryotes, Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria. The model can be used to predict the location of the cleavage site, which it finds correctly in nearly 70\% of signal peptides in a cross-validated test--almost the same accuracy as the best previous method. One of the problems for existing prediction methods is the poor discrimination between signal peptides and uncleaved signal anchors, but this is substantially improved by the hidden Markov model when expanding it with a very simple signal anchor model.},

It is a pair of β-sheets, with the facing side chains of the two sheets interdigitated in a dry ‘steric zipper’. Here we report some 30 other segments from fibril-forming proteins that form amyloid-like fibrils, microcrystals, or usually both. These include segments from the Alzheimer’s amyloid-β and tau proteins, the PrP prion protein, insulin, islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), lysozyme, myoglobin, α-synuclein and β2-microglobulin, suggesting that common structural features are shared by amyloid diseases at the molecular level. Structures of 13 of these microcrystals all reveal steric zippers, but with variations that expand the range of atomic architectures for amyloid-like fibrils and offer an atomic-level hypothesis for the basis of prion strains.},

The resulting reduced amino acid alphabets have been applied to pattern recognition, generation of consensus sequences from multiple alignments, protein folding, and protein structure prediction. In this work, amino acid substitution matrices and statistical potentials were derived based on several reduced amino acid alphabets and their performance assessed in a large benchmark for the tasks of sequence alignment and fold assessment of protein structure models, using as a reference frame the standard alphabet of 20 amino acids. The results showed that a large reduction in the total number of residue types does not necessarily translate into a significant loss of discriminative power for sequence alignment and fold assessment. Therefore, some definitions of a few residue types are able to encode most of the relevant sequence/structure information that is present in the 20 standard amino acids. Based on these results, we suggest that the use of reduced amino acid alphabets may allow to increasing the accuracy of current substitution matrices and statistical potentials for the prediction of protein structure of remote homologs.},

Having developed these tools, we use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of goodness of ?t than was possible in the 2nd Edition, and in Chapter 15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques.

This is mainly because proteins that can undergo structural changes, which lead to amyloid formation, are quite diverse and share no obvious sequence or structural homology, despite the structural similarity found in the fibrils. To address these issues, a novel approach based on recursive feature selection and feed-forward neural networks was undertaken to identify key features highly correlated with the self-assembly problem. This approach allowed the identification of seven physicochemical and biochemical properties of the amino acids highly associated with the self-assembly of peptides and proteins into amyloid-like fibrils (normalized frequency of β-sheet, normalized frequency of β-sheet from LG, weights for β-sheet at the window position of 1, isoelectric point, atom-based hydrophobic moment, helix termination parameter at position j+1 and ΔG° values for peptides extrapolated in 0 M urea). Moreover, these features enabled the development of a new predictor (available at  http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/appnn/index.html ) capable of accurately and reliably predicting the amyloidogenic propensity from the polypeptide sequence alone with a prediction accuracy of 84.9 \% against an external validation dataset of sequences with experimental  in vitro , evidence of amyloid formation.},

We estimate that reduced alphabets containing 10–12 letters can be used to design foldable sequences for a large number of protein families. This estimate is based on the observation that there is little loss of the information necessary to pick out structural homologs in a clustered protein sequence database when a suitable reduction of the amino acid alphabet from 20 to 10 letters is made, but that this information is rapidly degraded when further reductions in the alphabet are made.},

To complement other methods for classical signal peptide prediction we here present a publicly available method, TatP, for prediction of bacterial Tat signal peptides.
RESULTS: We have retrieved sequence data for Tat substrates in order to train a computational method for discrimination of Sec and Tat signal peptides. The TatP method is able to positively classify 91\% of 35 known Tat signal peptides and 84\% of the annotated cleavage sites of these Tat signal peptides were correctly predicted. This method generates far less false positive predictions on various datasets than using simple pattern matching. Moreover, on the same datasets TatP generates less false positive predictions than a complementary rule based prediction method.
CONCLUSION: The method developed here is able to discriminate Tat signal peptides from cytoplasmic proteins carrying a similar motif, as well as from Sec signal peptides, with high accuracy. The method allows filtering of input sequences based on Perl syntax regular expressions, whereas hydrophobicity discrimination of Tat- and Sec-signal peptides is carried out by an artificial neural network. A potential cleavage site of the predicted Tat signal peptide is also reported. The TatP prediction server is available as a public web server at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TatP/.},

	abstract = {Background
In this paper, it is proposed an optimization approach for producing reduced alphabets for peptide classification, using a Genetic Algorithm. The classification task is performed by a multi-classifier system where each classifier (Linear or Radial Basis function Support Vector Machines) is trained using features extracted by different reduced alphabets. Each alphabet is constructed by a Genetic Algorithm whose objective function is the maximization of the area under the ROC-curve obtained in several classification problems.

Results
The new approach has been tested in three peptide classification problems: HIV-protease, recognition of T-cell epitopes and prediction of peptides that bind human leukocyte antigens. The tests demonstrate that the idea of training a pool classifiers by reduced alphabets, created using a Genetic Algorithm, allows an improvement over other state-of-the-art feature extraction methods.

Conclusion
The validity of the novel strategy for creating reduced alphabets is demonstrated by the performance improvement obtained by the proposed approach with respect to other reduced alphabets-based methods in the tested problems.},

	abstract = {The amino acid composition (AAC) of proteomes differs greatly between microorganisms and is associated with the environmental niche they inhabit, suggesting that these changes may be adaptive. Similarly, the oligonucleotide composition of genomes varies and may confer advantages at the DNA/RNA level. These influences overlap in protein-coding sequences, making it difficult to gauge their relative contributions. We disentangle these effects by systematically evaluating the correspondence between intergenic nucleotide composition, where protein-level selection is absent, the AAC, and ecological parameters of 909 prokaryotes. We find that G + C content, the most frequently used measure of genomic composition, cannot capture diversity in AAC and across ecological contexts. However, di-/trinucleotide composition in intergenic DNA predicts amino acid frequencies of proteomes to the point where very little cross-species variability remains unexplained (91\% of variance accounted for). Qualitatively similar results were obtained for 49 fungal genomes, where 80\% of the variability in AAC could be explained by the composition of introns and intergenic regions. Upon factoring out oligonucleotide composition and phylogenetic inertia, the residual AAC is poorly predictive of the microbes' ecological preferences, in stark contrast with the original AAC. Moreover, highly expressed genes do not exhibit more prominent environment-related AAC signatures than lowly expressed genes, despite contributing more to the effective proteome. Thus, evolutionary shifts in overall AAC appear to occur almost exclusively through factors shaping the global oligonucleotide content of the genome. We discuss these results in light of contravening evidence from biophysical data and further reading frame-specific analyses that suggest that adaptation takes place at the protein level.},

However, plant-specific PTS1 protein prediction methods have been lacking up to now, and pre-existing methods generally were incapable of correctly predicting low-abundance plant proteins possessing non-canonical PTS1 patterns. Recently, we presented a machine learning approach that is able to predict PTS1 proteins for higher plants (spermatophytes) with high accuracy and which can correctly identify unknown targeting patterns, i.e. novel PTS1 tripeptides and tripeptide residues. Here we describe the first plant-specific web server PredPlantPTS1 for the prediction of plant PTS1 proteins using the above-mentioned underlying models. The server allows the submission of protein sequences from diverse spermatophytes and also performs well for mosses and algae. The easy-to-use web interface provides detailed output in terms of (i) the peroxisomal targeting probability of the given sequence, (ii) information whether a particular non-canonical PTS1 tripeptide has already been experimentally verified, and (iii) the prediction scores for the single C-terminal 14 amino acid residues. The latter allows identification of predicted residues that inhibit peroxisome targeting and which can be optimized using site-directed mutagenesis to raise the peroxisome targeting efficiency. The prediction server will be instrumental in identifying low-abundance and stress-inducible peroxisomal proteins and defining the entire peroxisomal proteome of Arabidopsis and agronomically important crop plants. PredPlantPTS1 is freely accessible at ppp.gobics.de.},

The equilibrium stability of the repacked proteins to thermal denaturation is enhanced relative to that of the wild-type protein. The rate of chemically induced folding and unfolding of wild-type Rop is extremely slow when compared with other small proteins. Interestingly, although the repacked proteins are more thermally stable than the wild type, their rates of chemically induced folding and unfolding are greatly increased in comparison to wild type.

We present a genetic algorithm for alphabet simplifying and we use it in a method based on global sequence alignment. We demonstrate that our algorithm is much faster and produces better results than the previously presented genetic algorithm. We also compare alphabets constructed on the base of universal substitution matrices like BLOSUM with our alphabets built through sequence alignment and propose a new coefficient describing the value of alphabets in the sequence alignment context. Finally we show that our simplified alphabets give better results in a sequence classification (using k-NN classifier), than most previously presented simplified alphabets and better than full 20-letter alphabet.},

To this end, we used a computer-designed algorithm to search for hexapeptide sequences with a high propensity to form homopolymeric beta-sheets. Sequences predicted to be highly favorable on this basis were found experimentally to self-associate efficiently into beta-sheets, whereas point mutations predicted to be unfavorable for this structure inhibited polymerization. However, the property to form polymeric beta-sheets is not a sufficient requirement for fibril formation because, under the conditions used here, preformed beta-sheets from these peptides with charged residues form well defined fibrils only if the total net charge of the molecule is +/-1. This finding illustrates the delicate balance of interactions involved in the formation of fibrils relative to more disordered aggregates. The present results, in conjunction with x-ray fiber diffraction, electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared measurements, have allowed us to propose a detailed structural model of the fibrils.},

The potential benefits ofthis procedure are faster and easier learning process as well as the generationof more compact and human-readable classifiers.The dimensionality reduction procedure we propose consists on the reductionof the 20-letter amino acid (AA) alphabet, which is normally used to specify a protein sequence, into a lower cardinality alphabet. This reduction comes about by a clustering of AA types accordingly to their physical and chemical similarity. Our automated reduction procedure is guided by a fitness function based on the Mutual Information between the AA-based input attributes of the dataset and the protein structure featurethat being predicted. To search for the optimal reduction, the Extended Compact Genetic Algorithm (ECGA) was used, and afterwards the results of this process were fed into (and validated by) BioHEL, a genetics-based machine learningtechnique. BioHEL used the reduced alphabet to induce rules forprotein structure prediction features. BioHEL results are compared to two standard machine learning systems. Our results show that it is possible to reduce the size of the alphabet used for prediction fromtwenty to just three letters resulting in more compact, i.e. interpretable,rules. Also, a protein-wise accuracy performance measure suggests that the loss of accuracy acrued by this substantial alphabet reduction is not statistically significant when compared to the full alphabet.},

To this end, we have performed a saturation mutagenesis analysis on the de novo-designed amyloid peptide STVIIE (1). The positional scanning mutagenesis has revealed that there is a position dependence on mutation of amyloid fibril formation and that both very tolerant and restrictive positions to mutation can be found within an amyloid sequence. In this system, mutations that accelerate β-sheet polymerization do not always lead to an increase of amyloid products. On the contrary, abundant fibrils are typically found for mutants that polymerize slowly. From these experiments, we have extracted a sequence pattern to identify amyloidogenic stretches in proteins. The pattern has been validated experimentally. In silico sequence scanning of amyloid proteins also supports the pattern. Analysis of protein databases has shown that highly amyloidogenic sequences matching the pattern are less frequent in proteins than innocuous amino acid combinations and that, if present, they are surrounded by amino acids that disrupt their aggregating capability (amyloid breakers). This study provides the potential for a proteome-wide scanning to detect fibril-forming regions in proteins, from which molecules can be designed to prevent and/or disrupt this process.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Amyloidogenic regions in polypeptide chains are very important because such regions are responsible for amyloid formation and aggregation. It is useful to be able to predict positions of amyloidogenic regions in protein chains.
RESULTS: Two characteristics (expected probability of hydrogen bonds formation and expected packing density of residues) have been introduced by us to detect amyloidogenic regions in a protein sequence. We demonstrate that regions with high expected probability of the formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds as well as regions with high expected packing density are mostly responsible for the formation of amyloid fibrils. Our method (FoldAmyloid) has been tested on a dataset of 407 peptides (144 amyloidogenic and 263 non-amyloidogenic peptides) and has shown good performance in predicting a peptide status: amyloidogenic or non-amyloidogenic. The prediction based on the expected packing density classified correctly 75\% of amyloidogenic peptides and 74\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Two variants (averaging by donors and by acceptors) of prediction based on the probability of formation of backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds gave a comparable efficiency. With a hybrid-scale constructed by merging the above three scales, our method is correct for 80\% of amyloidogenic peptides and for 72\% of non-amyloidogenic ones. Prediction of amyloidogenic regions in proteins where positions of amyloidogenic regions are known from experimental data has also been done. In the proteins, our method correctly finds 10 out of 11 amyloidogenic regions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the post-genomic era several methods of computational genomics are emerging to understand how the whole information is structured within genomes. Literature of last five years accounts for several alignment-free methods, arisen as alternative metrics for dissimilarity of biological sequences. Among the others, recent approaches are based on empirical frequencies of DNA k-mers in whole genomes.
RESULTS: Any set of words (factors) occurring in a genome provides a genomic dictionary. About sixty genomes were analyzed by means of informational indexes based on genomic dictionaries, where a systemic view replaces a local sequence analysis. A software prototype applying a methodology here outlined carried out some computations on genomic data. We computed informational indexes, built the genomic dictionaries with different sizes, along with frequency distributions. The software performed three main tasks: computation of informational indexes, storage of these in a database, index analysis and visualization. The validation was done by investigating genomes of various organisms. A systematic analysis of genomic repeats of several lengths, which is of vivid interest in biology (for example to compute excessively represented functional sequences, such as promoters), was discussed, and suggested a method to define synthetic genetic networks.
CONCLUSIONS: We introduced a methodology based on dictionaries, and an efficient motif-finding software application for comparative genomics. This approach could be extended along many investigation lines, namely exported in other contexts of computational genomics, as a basis for discrimination of genomic pathologies.},

An essential unsolved question regarding this prebiotic set is whether it defines a “foldable set”—that is, does it contain sufficient chemical information to permit cooperatively folding polypeptides? If so, what (if any) characteristic properties might such polypeptides exhibit? To investigate these questions, two “primitive” versions of an extant protein fold (the β-trefoil) were produced by top-down symmetric deconstruction, resulting in a reduced alphabet size of 12 or 13 amino acids and a percentage of prebiotic amino acids approaching 80\%. These proteins show a substantial acidification of pI and require high salt concentrations for cooperative folding. The results suggest that the prebiotic amino acids do comprise a foldable set within the halophile environment.},

	abstract = {The cellular attributes of a protein, such as which compartment of a cell it belongs to and how it is associated with the lipid bilayer of an organelle, are closely correlated with its biological functions. The success of human genome project and the rapid increase in the number of protein sequences entering into data bank have stimulated a challenging frontier: How to develop a fast and accurate method to predict the cellular attributes of a protein based on its amino acid sequence? The existing algorithms for predicting these attributes were all based on the amino acid composition in which no sequence order effect was taken into account. To improve the prediction quality, it is necessary to incorporate such an effect. However, the number of possible patterns for protein sequences is extremely large, which has posed a formidable difficulty for realizing this goal. To deal with such a difficulty, the pseudo-amino acid composition is introduced. It is a combination of a set of discrete sequence correlation factors and the 20 components of the conventional amino acid composition. A remarkable improvement in prediction quality has been observed by using the pseudo-amino acid composition. The success rates of prediction thus obtained are so far the highest for the same classification schemes and same data sets. It has not escaped from our notice that the concept of pseudo-amino acid composition as well as its mathematical framework and biochemical implication may also have a notable impact on improving the prediction quality of other protein features.},

	abstract = {Amyloids are proteins associated with the number of clinical disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's, Creutzfeldt-Jakob's and Huntington's diseases). Despite their diversity, all amyloid proteins can undergo aggregation initiated by 6- to 15-residue segments, called hot spots. To find the patterns defining the hot-spots, we trained predictors of amyloidogenicity, using n-grams and random forest classifiers, based on data collected in the AmyLoad database. Only the most informative n-grams, selected by our Quick Permutation Test, were considered. Since the amyloidogenicity may not depend on the exact sequence of amino acids but on more general properties of amino acids, we tested 524,284 reduced amino acid alphabets of different lengths (three to six letters) to find the alphabet providing the best performance in cross-validation. The predictor based on this alphabet, called AmyloGram, was benchmarked against the most popular tools for the detection of amyloid peptides using an external data set and obtained the highest values of performance measures (AUC: 0.90, MCC: 0.63). Our results showed sequential patterns in the amyloids, which are strongly correlated with hydrophobicity, a tendency to form ß-sheets and rigidity of amino acid residues. Among the most informative n-grams of AmyloGram we identified 15 that were already confirmed experimentally. AmyloGram is available as a web-server: www.smorfland.uni.wroc.pl/amylogram/. The code and results are publicly available at: www.github.com/michbur/prediction\_amyloidogenicity\_ngram/.},

Recent studies have identified many exceptions to the widely held view that signal sequences are simple, degenerate and interchangeable. Growing evidence indicates that signal sequences contain information that specifies the choice of targeting pathway, the efficiency of translocation, the timing of cleavage and even postcleavage functions. As a consequence, signal sequences can have important roles in modulating protein biogenesis. Based on a synthesis of studies in numerous experimental systems, we propose that substrate-specific sequence elements embedded in a conserved domain structure impart unique and physiologically important functionality to signal sequences.},

	abstract = {Signal peptides are short peptides located at the N-terminus of secreted proteins. They characteristically have three domains; a basic region at the N-terminus (n-region), a central hydrophobic core (h-region) and a carboxy-terminal cleavage region (c-region). Although hundreds of different signal peptides have been identified, it has not been completely understood how their features enable signal peptides to influence protein expression. Antibody-derived signal peptides are often used to prepare recombinant antibodies expressed by eukaryotic cells, especially Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, when prokaryotic Escherichia coli (E. coli) are utilized in drug discovery processes, such as for phage display selection or antibody humanization, signal peptides have been selected separately due to the differences in the expression systems between the species. In this study, we successfully established a signal peptide that enables a functional antibody to be expressed in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells by focusing on the importance of having an Ala residue in the c-region of the signal sequence. We found that changing Ser to Ala at only two positions significantly augmented the anti-HER2 antigen binding fragment (Fab) expression in E. coli. In addition, this altered signal peptide also retained the ability to express functional anti-HER2 antibody in CHO cells. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the signal peptide can promote functional antibody expression in both prokaryotic E. coli and eukaryotic CHO cells. This finding will contribute to the understanding of signal peptides and accelerate therapeutic antibody research.},

	abstract = {It is thought that two to three thousand different proteins are targeted to the chloroplast, and the 'transit peptides' that act as chloroplast targeting sequences are probably the largest class of targeting sequences in plants. At a primary structural level, transit peptide sequences are highly divergent in length, composition and organization. An emerging concept suggests that transit peptides contain multiple domains that provide either distinct or overlapping functions. These functions include direct interaction with envelope lipids, chloroplast receptors and the stromal processing peptidase. The genomic organization of transit peptides suggests that these domains might have originated from distinct exons, which were shuffled and streamlined throughout evolution to yield a modern, multifunctional transit peptide. Although still poorly characterized, this evolutionary process could yield transit peptides with different domain organizations. The plasticity of transit peptide design is consistent with the diverse biological functions of chloroplast proteins.},

	abstract = {Background Most of the parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa contain a relict prokaryotic-derived plastid called the apicoplast. This organelle is important not only for the survival of the parasite, but its unique properties make it an ideal drug target. The majority of apicoplast-associated proteins are nuclear encoded and targeted post-translationally to the organellar lumen via a bipartite signaling mechanism that requires an N-terminal signal and transit peptide (TP). Attempts to define a consensus motif that universally identifies apicoplast TPs have failed.   Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we propose a generalized rule-based classification model to identify apicoplast-targeted proteins (ApicoTPs) that use a bipartite signaling mechanism. Given a training set specific to an organism, this model, called ApicoAP, incorporates a procedure based on a genetic algorithm to tailor a discriminating rule that exploits the known characteristics of ApicoTPs. Performance of ApicoAP is evaluated for four labeled datasets of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium yoelii, Babesia bovis, and Toxoplasma gondii proteins. ApicoAP improves the classification accuracy of the published dataset for P. falciparum to 94\%, originally 90\% using PlasmoAP.   Conclusions/Significance We present a parametric model for ApicoTPs and a procedure to optimize the model parameters for a given training set. A major asset of this model is that it is customizable to different parasite genomes. The ApicoAP prediction software is available at http://code.google.com/p/apicoap/ and http://bcb.eecs.wsu.edu.},

	abstract = {We analyzed the nucleotide contents of several completely sequenced genomes, and we show that nucleotide bias can have a dramatic effect on the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins. By surveying the genes in 21 completely sequenced eubacterial and archaeal genomes, along with the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome and two Plasmodium falciparum chromosomes, we show that biased DNA encodes biased proteins on a genomewide scale. The predicted bias affects virtually all genes within the genome, and it could be clearly seen even when we limited the analysis to sets of homologous gene sequences. Parallel patterns of compositional bias were found within the archaea and the eubacteria. We also found a positive correlation between the degree of amino acid bias and the magnitude of protein sequence divergence. We conclude that mutational bias can have a major effect on the molecular evolution of proteins. These results could have important implications for the interpretation of protein-based molecular phylogenies and for the inference of functional protein adaptation from comparative sequence data.},

	issn = {1471-2105},
	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-10-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We investigate automated and generic alphabet reduction techniques for protein structure prediction datasets. Reducing alphabet cardinality without losing key biochemical information opens the door to potentially faster machine learning, data mining and optimization applications in structural bioinformatics. Furthermore, reduced but informative alphabets often result in, e.g., more compact and human-friendly classification/clustering rules. In this paper we propose a robust and sophisticated alphabet reduction protocol based on mutual information and state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
RESULTS: We applied this protocol to the prediction of two protein structural features: contact number and relative solvent accessibility. For both features we generated alphabets of two, three, four and five letters. The five-letter alphabets gave prediction accuracies statistically similar to that obtained using the full amino acid alphabet. Moreover, the automatically designed alphabets were compared against other reduced alphabets taken from the literature or human-designed, outperforming them. The differences between our alphabets and the alphabets taken from the literature were quantitatively analyzed. All the above process had been performed using a primary sequence representation of proteins. As a final experiment, we extrapolated the obtained five-letter alphabet to reduce a, much richer, protein representation based on evolutionary information for the prediction of the same two features. Again, the performance gap between the full representation and the reduced representation was small, showing that the results of our automated alphabet reduction protocol, even if they were obtained using a simple representation, are also able to capture the crucial information needed for state-of-the-art protein representations.
CONCLUSION: Our automated alphabet reduction protocol generates competent reduced alphabets tailored specifically for a variety of protein datasets. This process is done without any domain knowledge, using information theory metrics instead. The reduced alphabets contain some unexpected (but sound) groups of amino acids, thus suggesting new ways of interpreting the data.},
